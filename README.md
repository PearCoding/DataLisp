# DataLisp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PearCoding/DataLisp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PearCoding/DataLisp)

DataLisp is an modular and modable configuration scripting language

More information about DataLisp here:
<http://pearcoding.eu/projects/datalisp>

At the moment you can build the library for Windows and Linux with cmake.
Currently there is no tested support for MacOS X, but due to the non-use of external libraries,
there should be no problems.

There is also an official C# port: <https://github.com/PearCoding/DataLisp-CSharp>
